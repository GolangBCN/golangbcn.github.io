This July, we'll be holding some lightning talks in our meetup, hosted at [Social Point]... Thank you!
The lightning talks will be 5 minutes long, no questions, no discussion, quick and fast.
[Present] your project, idea, preferred tool in our lightning talks session.
We'll contact you back for the details.
Remember to RSVP at the [event meetup page]... Keep reading for details on accepted lightning talks...

<!--more-->

So far, we received and confirmed these talks:

  - [Gustavo Chaín] on [sqlhooks], a library to instrument your application DB queries for log and measurement.
  - [Xavi Soler] on [Dog], a command line tool to execute tasks.
  - [Gonzalo Serrano] on [gRPC], is a high performant RPC framework by Google which uses protocol buffers to define the message types and uses HTTP2 behind the scenes. 
  - [Albert Puigsech] on [seekret], a tool for preventing secret leakage on GitHub (and others).
  - [Aitor Guevara] will show up the [New Relic Go agent] in action! 

Stay tuned, since we'll be updating this list.
