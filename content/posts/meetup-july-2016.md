This July, we'll be holding some lightning talks in our meetup, hosted at [Social Point]... Thank you!
The lightning talks will be 5 minutes long, no questions, no discussion, quick and fast.
[Present] your project, idea, preferred tool in our lightning talks session.
We'll contact you back for the details.
Remember to RSVP at the [event meetup page]... Keep reading for details on accepted lightning talks...

So far, we received and confirmed these talks:

  - [Gustavo Chaín] on [sqlhooks], a library to instrument your application DB queries for log and measurement.
