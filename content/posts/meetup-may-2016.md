Winter has leaved us, and spring is here with not only two, but three!!!!!!!!
Awesome great talks delivered by [Xavi], [Enric] and [Ivan] in this great [event].

The [event], held at [Infojobs]'s offices, started with [Xavi]'s talk about his life and love for Go and how these feelings merged with Docker so well.
