We're happy to announce we'll be having our [first 2016's meetup] on January 20th, hosted by [Typeform].
This time we'll host two great talks:

- [Daniel Martí] will talk about *[Interfacer]*, a linter that goes beyond by suggesting interface types, and
- [Gonzalo Serrano] will enlighten about *Vim and Go*

Doesn't that sound awesome?
Thank you to the speakers, and all of the attendees.
We hope you enjoy this session.
