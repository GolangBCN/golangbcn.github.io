We're happy to announce we'll be having our first 2016's meetup on January 20th.

<!--more-->

[The event] has been already announced, and it will be hosted by [Typeform].
This time we'll host two great talks:

- [Daniel Martí] will [talk] about *[Interfacer]*, a linter that goes beyond by suggesting interface types, and
- [Gonzalo Serrano] will [enlighten us] about *Vim and Go*

Doesn't that sound awesome?
We hope you'll enjoy this session.
