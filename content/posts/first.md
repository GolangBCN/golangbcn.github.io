We're really happy to announce this blog's release, for enhancement of GolangBCN's group communication.
Last year's ending was plenty of activity, and this blog was a long wanted feature for our group.
With the will to bring more activity and freshness to our group, we have finished this one.

Might be interesting to mention that the blog is made with [Hugo] on [GitHub Pages].
So it's a static site, which reduces maintenance tasks to a minimum.
We have plans to make a couple of improvements, so it would be easy to publish and contribute to it, through [Travis] for automation of revision, approval, and publishing tasks.
