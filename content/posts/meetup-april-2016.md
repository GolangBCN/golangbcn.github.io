Next wednesday, April 20th, we'll have our third 2016's meetup, hosted at [Social Point], with two talks, one
from [J. Roi Martin] and [Sergi Martínez], and the other from [Social Point]. Looks promising!

So, this time we'll have two talks:

- *Golang in Social Point, experiences and lessons learnt* by [Social Point] engineers, about their way to Go.

- *All your queue are belong to us*, about [rpcmq](https://github.com/jroimartin/rpcmq), with [godan](https://github.com/zlowram/godan-dist)
  as a use case, by [J. Roi Martin] and [Sergi Martínez].
