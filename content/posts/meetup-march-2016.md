We had the second 2016's meetup, this time with a Hangout On Air (recorded) talk by [William Kennedy],
['Go In Action'] co-author, and [Ivan Fraixedes], fellow of this, and other, meetups :)

[The event], held at [Onebox]'s offices, was announced some time ago, but we skipped to publish this article in advance.
Sorry about that! We'll try to improve on iterating.

This time we had two talks:

- [William Kennedy] talked about performance and productivity when solving problems with code.
- [Ivan Fraixedes] talked on [Go's out of the box provided profiling tools].

You will be able to review the recording as soon as we can publish it... Be patient!
